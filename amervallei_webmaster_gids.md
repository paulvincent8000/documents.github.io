### Backup and Recovery via Hosting Provider
The hosting provider has a very solid backup and recovery system. Backups are made automatically every day and are retained for 14 days.

Manual backups can be made as desired and kept for unlimited time. To protect the site two items must be backed up at the same time:
- Database
- Files (Webruimte)

_Always make a manual backup before any major work on the site!_

Backup and recovery can be accessed via the [control panel][f9510030].
